# Sleep When You Die

A simple python code to keep the system awake.

It presses CAPSLOCK twice every 5 minutes. The duration can be changed by changing the ```mins``` variable.

Place the batch script in the startup folder so it runs whenever you start the computer.

Keep the .py and .bat file together, or change the file location in .bat to where ever the .py file is.

### Requirements
- ```pip install PyAutoGUI```

A better option would be write a shell script. :man_shrugging:
