# Sleep When You Die

A simple python code to keep the system awake.

It presses CAPSLOCK twice every 5 minutes. The duration can be changed by changing the ```mins``` variable.

:warning: **To stop the code, move the cursor to the top right corner of the screen.**

### To Do
- Place the batch script in the startup folder so it runs whenever you start the computer.

- Keep the .py and .bat file together, or change the file location in .bat to where ever the .py file is.

### Requirements
- ```pip install PyAutoGUI```
